Back to the Comments (Hacker News)
====================

This is a chrome extension. It's meant to help with your "workflow" when procrastinating on Hacker News. Basically it allows you to navigate back to a post's comments without having to go through the homepage (uses a page action). 

If you happen upon this **please do not post it anywhere**. The main functionality of it is there, I use it on a daily basis and you might want to too, but it still needs a bit more polish before it's worth publishing on the chrome app store etc.

Pull requests welcome.

Thanks.
