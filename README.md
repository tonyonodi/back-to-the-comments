back-to-the-comments
====================

This is a chrome extension. It's meant to help with your "workflow" when procrastinating on Hacker News. Basically it allows you to navigate back to a post's comments without having to go through the homepage (uses a page action). 

If you happen upon this **please do not post it anywhere**. It absolutely isn't ready yet. It flat out doesn't work for posts that link to Github or Medium, two sites that are occasionally(!) linked to on HN.

If you're here and you've managed to work out why it doesn't work on these pages then feel free to let me know. Pull requests welcome.

Thanks.
